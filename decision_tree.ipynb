    "# Traditional ML Models for ZKML: Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this series of tutorials, we delve into the world of traditional machine learning models for ZKML. Despite the hype surrounding advanced AI techniques, traditional ML models often offer superior performance or sufficiently robust results for specific applications. This is particularly true for ZKML use cases, where computational proof costs can be a critical factor. We aim to equip you with guides on how to implement machine learning algorithms suitable for Giza platform applications. This includes practical steps for converting your scikit-learn models to the ONNX format, transpiling them to Orion Cairo, and deploying inference endpoints for prediction in AI Action.*\n",

    "To streamline a verifiable inference, you might consider using the endpoint URL obtained after transpilation. However, this approach requires manual serialization of the input for the Cairo program and handling the deserialization process. To make this process more user-friendly and keep you within a Python environment, we've introduced AI Actionsâ€”a Python SDK designed to facilitate the creation of ML workflows and execution of verifiable predictions. When you initiate a prediction, our system automatically retrieves the endpoint URL you deployed earlier, converts your input into Cairo-compatible format, executes the prediction, and then converts the output back into a numpy object.
